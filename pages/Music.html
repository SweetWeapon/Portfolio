            <h1>Music</h1>
            <p>My favorite song is: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a09Lle-Q6g4" target="_blank">Lil Peep The song they played</a></p>
            <p>Lil Peep is my favorite rapper/singer but he died 2 years ago</p>
            <p>He makes music about depression, about taking drugs and also about love</p>
            <p>His most famous song is Falling Down with XXXTentacion with 380 million plays on spotify</p>
            <p>He also has a lot of face tattoos so when he wanted to quit music he couldn't get another job</p>
